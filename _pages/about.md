Welcome to my personal website. I am Kenta Suzuki from Japan, and work full-time as research and development engineer of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for [Teijin Limited](https://www.teijincarbon.com/), one of the leading manufacturers of carbon fibers in the world. Prior to the position at Teijin, I have finished M.S. degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics at University of Washington (Seattle, WA). I was a member of the [Laboratory for Multiscale Analysis of Materials and Structures](http://mamslab.com/), suppervised by [Dr. Marco Salviato](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/marco-salviato), and have studied computational modeling of composite materials (e.g. fiber reinforced plastics). 

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
