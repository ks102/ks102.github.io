Welcome to my personal website. I am Kenta Suzuki from Japan, and work full-time as a research and development engineer of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for [**Teijin Limited**](https://www.teijincarbon.com/), one of the leading manufacturers of carbon fibers in the world. Prior to the position at Teijin, I received a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the **University of Washington** (Seattle, WA). I was a member of the [Laboratory for Multiscale Analysis of Materials & Structures](http://mamslab.com/), suppervised by [Dr. Marco Salviato](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/marco-salviato), and studied computational modeling of composite materials utilizing novel numerical methods.

Experiecne
======

Development of fiber optimization scheme for curvilinear fiber reinforced plastics (FRP), developement of Iso-Geometric Analysis (IGA) framework for curvilinear anisotropic media, scripting of standard finite element method (FEM) by Python and MATLAB, numerical analysis of FRP/textile composites utilizing Abaqus, Ansys, FreeCAD, resin formulation, thermal analysis of polymers, manufacturing of CFRP, etc.
